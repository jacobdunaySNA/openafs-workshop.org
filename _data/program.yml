      Linux kernel afs (kafs) and AF_RXRPC have inspired the
      development of many Linux subsystems including keyrings,
      keyutils, FS-cache, file system namespaces, and the new
      mount api which in turn have influenced the development of
      NFS, CIFS, Plan9 and Ceph. This talk discusses the current
      state of these technologies, how kafs was added to the
      Fedora Core distribution, and the next steps in its
      development.

      As part of Apple's ongoing effort to modernize macOS,
      improve security and reliability, recent versions of macOS
      have enforced new requirements for third-party software. In
      this talk, we will have a brief discussion about  how the
      OpenAFS client has been affected by these requirements, what
      changes have been made, and what to expect in the future.

      How building secondary storage architecture and choosing the
      right software solutions can provide benefits in compliance,
      performance, and capacity while simultaneously creating more
      backup and archive options for your organization.
      Considerations include multiple storage pools, secondary
      storage targets, direct to tape vs D2D2T and single file
      restores in AFS technology volume sets.  Backup and recovery
      solutions must be approached in a manner designed to break
      performance barriers in AFS technologies and other
      platforms.

  - title: Interoperability of AFS and AuriStor with Backup and Restore

      OpenAFS and AuriStor continue to develop and introduce new
      features.  Backup and restore software should provide
      solutions designed to simultaneously recover both of these
      AFS technologies in the event updates result in unintended
      and undesired consequences.  The solution should also be
      capable of protecting organizational data in operations
      running multiple cells, transitioning between the solutions,
      or deploying both technologies to ensure organizational data
      integrity and business continuity.

  - title: OpenAFS as Persistent Storage using Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin and Testing framework for CSI plugin.
    presenters: Pravin Junnarkar, Todd DeSantis, Yadavendra Yadav

      This talk is in continuation of last year's talk on OpenAFS
      CSI Plugin. It will focus on certain enhancements in CSI
      plugin mainly on handling volume lifecycle management along
      with security considerations.  We are also trying to add
      operator support for CSI plugin, where AFS CSI Plugin will
      be added as custom Resource in K8s and will be managed by
      Operator.

      This talk will also focus on a Testing framework designed
      for OpenAFS CSI.  This testing framework has been developed
      using Kubernetes python APIs which provides easy portability
      on various platforms. The framework covers exhaustive
      scenarios like many pods accessing single Openafs volume,
      one pod accessing multiple volumes, etc. This framework is
      having a modular design which makes it easy to test
      different scenarios like parallel Read/Write of volumes,
      ReadOnly access to volumes, create/delete multiple volumes
      at a time. One can also make use of this framework for
      OpenAFS workload testing by allowing hundreds of threads to
      run in parallel to access volumes. The framework supports a
      declarative model that helps in extending test matrix
      easily.

  - title: NIST 800-171 considerations for storage

      Organizations deploying AFS technologies may soon have
      internal or research data subject to NIST 800-171 security
      standards under executive orders from both President Obama
      and President Trump.  Funding for U.S.  government federal
      agencies, commercial U.S. government federal contractors,
      and Educational institutions both domestic and international
      who are receiving grants or other U.S. government federal
      aid will become increasingly subject to compliance.
      Teradactyl will discuss NIST 800-171 requirements for
      controlled unclassified information.  Learn the requirements
      and how organizations can adopt a compliant backup and
      archive solution for AFS technologies, HPC environments, and
      other heterogeneous computing platforms.

  - title: OpenAFS diagnostic tools

      This talk will provide an overview of the many in-tree
      OpenAFS diagnostic utilities and commands, including when to
      use (or not use) them.  This talk is intended to provide
      practical troubleshooting advice for administrators
      maintaining production cells.  However, non-admins may also
      find the big picture approach helpful in better
      understanding how the various components of an AFS cell
      interact with each other.

  - title: Handling DAFS volume packages dynamically through fssync-debug
    presenters: Ganesh G Chaudhari, Kailas Zadbuke, Todd DeSantis
    org: IBM
    cat: trouble

    len: 30
    desc: >
      The fssync-debug is a command suite that allows low-level
      inspection and control of the DA file-server volume
      packages. Running this command suit requires understanding
      of the volume finite-state machine and their various volume
      states. A finite state machine is a computation model that
      is implemented considering the various AFS volume states and
      used to simulate sequential logic. Finite state machines can
      be used to model problems in many fields. fssync-debug
      command suit operates at an extremely low-level and hence
      requires detailed knowledge of the AFS architecture and
      code.  As a part of presentation, we will cover various
      volume states and how to dynamically handle DAFS volume
      packages using command suit options of fsync-debug like;
      attach, detach, online, offline, callback, etc.  We will
      also touch on analogous command suit salvsync-debug and FSM
      flow during this talk

  - title: PAGs... Unthrottled

      What are Process Authentication Groups (PAGs), and why does
      the OpenAFS Unix client throttle them? In this talk, we'll
      explore some background of PAGs, and some issues and
      management techniques that may be interesting to
      administrators. We'll be sure to look at the throttling
      behavior in particular, and some proposed changes to
      eliminate the need for throttling.

  - title: Wireshark and AFS

      Wireshark is a popular open-source utility for network
      packet capture and analysis, and has supported the Rx and
      AFS3 protocols for many years.  This talk will start with a
      short introduction to Wireshark.  We'll then discuss real
      world experiences in using Wireshark to analyze AFS traffic.
      Along the way, we'll give some tips and hints, describe some
      quirks of the current implementation, discuss recent
      improvements to the Rx and AFS dissectors, and provide a
      demo.  This talk is geared toward administrators, network
      engineers, and developers, but should also be of interest to
      users who are curious to learn more about the 'network' part
      of our favorite network file system.

      How the OpenAFS client integrates with the kernel for each
      supported platform is a critical but esoteric part of how
      the client works.  Inspired by recent efforts to get the
      FreeBSD client stable, we'll take a look at how we deal with
      the different styles of VFS APIs supported by the Unix
      client: particularly Solaris, Linux, and BSD (including OS
      X).  This is primarily for developers, but may also be
      interesting for anyone who wants to know what "dynamic
      vcaches" actually means.

  - title: Using Virtualization to debug the OpenAFS Linux kernel module
    presenters: Cheyenne Wills

    time: 13:45
    len: 30
    desc: >
      Several of the Linux virtualization engines provide
      facilities that allow a running guest system to be examined
      and controlled by a source code debugger.  With these
      facilities and some knowledge of the internals of the
      OpenAFS kernel module, the debugger can be used
      interactively to pause and examine the internal state and
      memory of a running guest system.  In this talk we will
      focus on setting up and starting a debugging session to take
      a quick peek inside a running OpenAFS kernel module.

  - title: Kata lightweight VMs for OpenAFS scalability testing.

      The traditional performance/scalability testing with the
      OpenAFS module has the requirement of multiple Bare-metal
      systems or virtual machines which is cost-intensive and the
      setup itself is a laborious process.  An alternative to this
      is a widely used containerization approach but their core
      capability of sharing the host kernel is actually the
      limitation with OpenAFS since each OpenAFS client has to
      work with its own kernel module.  To overcome these
      challenges, we investigated Kata Containers. Kata provides a
      standard implementation of lightweight virtual machines
      (VMs) that feels and performs like containers, but provide
      the workload isolation and security advantages of VMs.  The
      session highlights how the automated OpenAFS testing
      framework is effectively using Docker and Kata to provide a
      reusable and easily reproducible infrastructure for faster
      scalability/performance testing.

      This talk is an update to the 2015 talk by the same name
      which describes the challenges of developing and maintaining
      both in-tree and out-of-tree filesystems for the Linux
      kernel; and then presents the techniques that AuriStor uses
      to develop and test both the AuriStorFS and kafs kernel
      modules on supported Linux distributions.

      Recent laws such as Europe's General Data Protection
      Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act have
      provided end users with legal remedies if organizations do
      not protect the privacy of their end user's identities and
      personal information.  This talk will discuss the challenges
      of data loss prevention as well as user identity harvesting.
      Each risk area will be followed by an overview of techniques
      that can enabled when using AuriStorFS to reduce and manage
      the risks.

  - title: Complying with Key Rotation Policies using AuriStorFS

      Many organizations are required to perform key rotation for
      network services on a regular cycle with typical periods
      ranging from 60 to 180 days.  Key rotation is relatively
      easy for stand-alone services such as a host's Kerberos
      keytab.  However, when keys must be rotated for a
      distributed service a failure to update any one instance's
      key can result in an outage.  This talk will present the
      techniques that can be used with AuriStorFS to rotate
      cell-wide rxkad_krb5 and yfs-rxgk keys without the risk of
      outages.

  - title: OpenAFS Cache Manager tracing using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)

      For debugging Linux Kernel issues in OpenAFS we use dynamic
      tracers like systemTap, perf, kprobe/kretprobe etc. Dynamic
      tracer like systemTap requires certain packages to be
      installed on a system, and it creates a kernel module which
      gets loaded in kernel to make probes active, same is a case
      with kprobe & kretprobe. eBPF can be used to trace a custom
      kernel module (like OpenAFS) and is part of Linux kernel
      itself. Also eBPF creates a register based Virtual machine
      which runs JIT native compiled Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)
      programs and this makes it more safe to use in production
      environment. eBPF stack also have verifier in place which
      will make sure BPF programs do not create issues, e.g.
      loops, null pointer deference etc. eBPF can also be used for
      tracing user space programs. In this talk we will focus on
      architecture of eBPF and how it can be used for profiling,
      dynamic tracing and instrumentation of OpenAFS kernel
      module. We will also touch on tracing userspace processes
      like AFS servers.

      The current VLDB on-disk format, version 4, has long been
      known to have numerous restrictions and limitations. A
      proposed VLDB version 5 aims to fix these by completely
      revamping the format; we'll talk about the architecture of
      the format, some new features, and how upgrades and
      downgrades will work for administrators.

      AuriStor RX and Linux RX_RPC have pushed the RX protocol to
      its limits.  This talk will present several proposals for RX
      protocol extensions which could improve the efficiency on
      LANs and throughput on high throughput high latency
      networks.  These include proposals to increase the effective
      size of the selective acknowledgment table, negotiate large
      packet sizes up to 64K, and more.
