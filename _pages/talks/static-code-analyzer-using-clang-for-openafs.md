This presentation will talk about the static code analysis. The method of
debugging by examining source code before a program is run is called as static
analysis. Hence static code analysis can potentially find bugs in code before
actual runtime.  The Clang Static Analyzer is a source code analyser tool which
can be used to find the bugs in the OpenAFS project as it is written in C/C++.
The Clang analyser is open source and it is a part of the Clang and LLVM
project.

In this talk, we will focus on how Clang will be used in OpenAFS code to find
the bugs.
