Jprobe is a probing technique, which can be used to access the target functionâ€™s
arguments. It employs a simple mirroring principle to allow seamless access to
the probed function's arguments. Jprobe is deprecated and has been removed from
kernel and not available 4.19 kernel onward. This talk focusses on alternative
of Jprobe.
