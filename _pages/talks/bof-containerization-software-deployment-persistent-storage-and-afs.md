Talks have been presented at various forum over the last five years on how to
integrate AFS with various containerization technologies to facilitate software
deployment and persistent storage.  In that time IBM and AuriStor have both
developed Container Storage Interfaces for Kubernetes and Special Resource
Operators for OpenShift.  Yet, there has been little real world adoption.

The goal of this BOF is to discuss the benefits of combining AFS and
containerization, the real world challenges, and the steps that must be taken to
foster wider adoption by end user communities.
