This talk will be in continuation of last yearâ€™s talk on OpenAFS CSI Plugin. It
will mainly focus on the issues that the customers faced and solutions that we
provided. We will also talk about the issues we faced with installing kernel
packages through RedHat subscription. For this we had to add few more
configurable parameters to our OpenAFS configuration file that can change
according to the RedHat version installed by the user. We have added new
support to have the OpenAFS CSI plugin interface to work on Ubuntu nodes using
s390x platforms, we plan to talk about it in more details in presentation.
