Like all ubik databases in Openafs, the VLDB currently uses a custom on-disk
format that has numerous annoyances and limitations. In this talk, we'll look at
some recent work to migrate to a VLDB built on existing key-value databases
instead, as well as some new tools for upgrading/downgrading the VLDB and more.
