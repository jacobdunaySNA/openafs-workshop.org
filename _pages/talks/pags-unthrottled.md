What are Process Authentication Groups (PAGs), and why does the OpenAFS Unix
client throttle them? In this talk, we'll explore some background of PAGs, and
some issues and management techniques that may be interesting to administrators.
We'll be sure to look at the throttling behavior in particular, and some
proposed changes to eliminate the need for throttling.
