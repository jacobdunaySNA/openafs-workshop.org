Goldman Sachs is working to migrate from a bare metal and virtual host
infrastructure toward one that leverages containers. That current
infrastructure makes use of a software deployment strategy using AuriStorFS as
the last mile distribution mechanism. Goldman Sachs' work with OpenShift for
this triggered AuriStor to develop a solution to seamlessly provide access to
AuriStorFS delivered software from within the containers. We will discuss
Goldman Sachs' current progress, details of the implementation, AuriStorâ€™s work
to provide AuriStorFS to containers, and we will offer an overview of the
technology provided by OpenShift to implement this solution.
