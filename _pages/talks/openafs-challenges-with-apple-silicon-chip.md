This presentation will talk about the challenges which we faced to support
OpenAFS on apple silicon chip (i.e arm64 architecture).  We will walkthrough
over some of the issues and how we conquered it. We will also cover some
aspects of standalone universal binary that works well in both x86 and arm64
architectures.
