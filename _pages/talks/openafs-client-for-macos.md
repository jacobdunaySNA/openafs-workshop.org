As part of Apple's ongoing effort to modernize macOS, improve security and
reliability, recent versions of macOS have enforced new requirements for
third-party software. In this talk, we will have a brief discussion about
how the OpenAFS client has been affected by these requirements, what changes have
been made, and what to expect in the future.
