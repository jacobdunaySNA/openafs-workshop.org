In January 2021 CERN published a report entitled "Future of User Storage at
CERN".  The report compares a variety of file system technologies. The report
says some nice things about AFS-family filesystems including that "AFS is most
mature and stable client implementation (according to our experience)" and the
working group ranks AFS second only to Lustre in terms of scaling the number of
clients.  Still "the working group sees an interest in moving out of AFS as a
long term plan, mainly because of software aging issues that have been exposed
in the technology survey, such as the support for IPv6, HA, etc."

This BOF should consist of various stakeholders to discuss the future of
AFS-family filesystems and the importance secure global namespace filesystems
will play in the future.
