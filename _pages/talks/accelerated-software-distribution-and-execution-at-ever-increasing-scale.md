A brief summary of the topic More software packages, larger software packages,
increased update frequency, to more clients, in more geographic regions, across
increasingly diverse infrastructures, with faster execution times. What has
been done to accomplish the gains we've realized, how do we continue the
acceleration?

I’ll discuss how we're driving change to AFS to improve the performance of
software deployment. This discussion will include magic mount and other UNIX
cache manager changes, as well as changes to RX, UBIK, and the file server. All
of these have provided significant performance improvements

I’ll talk about what we saw in the past that drove us to what we see today, and
where we hope to go.
