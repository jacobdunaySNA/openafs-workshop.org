This talk will provide an overview of the many in-tree OpenAFS diagnostic
utilities and commands, including when to use (or not use) them.  This talk is
intended to provide practical troubleshooting advice for administrators
maintaining production cells.  However, non-admins may also find the big picture
approach helpful in better understanding how the various components of an AFS
cell interact with each other.
