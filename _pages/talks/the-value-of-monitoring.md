We will recount the true story of how proactive monitoring of an AFS cell
produced high business value, not only for the monitored site, but also for the
AFS community at large.  Using a real world example, we will illustrate how
simple monitoring revealed several previously-unknown Rx connection leaks.
Along the way, we will provide tips on how to gather additional AFS
diagnostics, how to monitor AFS, and how to transform monitoring data into
business value.
