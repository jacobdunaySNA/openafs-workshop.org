Wireshark is a popular open-source utility for network packet capture and
analysis, and has supported the Rx and AFS3 protocols for many years.  This talk
will start with a short introduction to Wireshark.  We will then discuss real
world experiences in using Wireshark to analyze AFS traffic.  Along the way, we
will give some tips and hints, describe some quirks of the current
implementation, discuss recent improvements to the Rx and AFS dissectors, and
provide a demo.  This talk is geared toward administrators, network engineers,
and developers, but should also be of interest to users who are curious to learn
more about the network part of our favorite network file system.
