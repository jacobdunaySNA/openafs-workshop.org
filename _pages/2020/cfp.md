share with others.  We invite you to submit a session proposal to share your
experience with colleagues in the AFS community.  Sessions types at the
workshop include presentations, panels, tutorials, and roundtable discussions.

**Everyone** is encouraged to speak.

## Why Present

* **Friendly Audiences**

## Topics of Interest

Any topic generally related to AFS technologies will be considered. Areas of
interest include, but are not limited too:

* Site Reports
* Best Practices and Lessons Learned
* Novel use cases for AFS
* Development efforts
* Tools and technology integration
* Performance, networking, security
* Testing and test automation
* Or anything else AFS related you would like to discuss or showcase

Have a neat new tool you wrote that saves you time and effort? Tell us about
it. Have an idea you want to try out on a bunch of people? Tell us about it.
Have you done some performance tuning, benchmarking, or automated testing?  We
would love to hear more!
