---

The AFS Workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate
harassment of conference participants in any form.  Conference participants
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without
a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being kind to others
* Behaving professionally
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Harassment of conference participants in any form, in person or online
* Bullying, insults, or put downs
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks and clothing.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* Excessive swearing
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Unwelcome physical contact
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at conference venues, including but not limited to
explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for
hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing
injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will
be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the
weapon.

Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this
matter.

## Scope

All AFS Workshop attendees are subject to the Code of Conduct. This includes
staff, volunteers, as well as attendees of receptions, sponsored or unofficial
events.

Exhibitors in the expo area, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities
are also subject to the Code of Conduct. In particular, exhibitors should not
use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including
volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise
create a sexualized environment.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
