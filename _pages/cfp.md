Call for Presentations Deadline: April 18, 2023

The 2023 AFS Technologies Workshop is a community based effort to promote the
stability and growth of the AFS distributed file system and related
technologies.

We believe that all members of the AFS community have something valuable to
share with others.  We invite you to submit a session proposal to share your
experience with colleagues in the AFS community.  Sessions types at the
workshop include presentations, panels, tutorials, and roundtable discussions.

The workshop registration fee will be refunded for speakers.

## Why Present

* **Friendly Audiences**
* **Rewarding Experience**

## Topics of Interest

Any topic generally related to AFS technologies will be considered. Areas of
interest include, but are not limited too:

* Site Reports
* Best Practices and Lessons Learned
* Novel use cases for AFS
* Development efforts
* Tools and technology integration
* Performance, networking, security
* Testing and test automation
* Or anything else AFS related you would like to discuss or showcase

Have a neat new tool you wrote that saves you time and effort? Tell us about
it. Have an idea you want to try out on a bunch of people? Tell us about it.
Have you done some performance tuning, benchmarking, or automated testing?  We
would love to hear more!
