The OpenAFS Workshop is a community based effort
to promote the stability and growth of the AFS
distributed file system and related technologies.

We believe that all members of the AFS community
have something valuable to share with others.
We invite you to submit a session proposal to
share your experience with colleagues in the AFS
community.  Sessions types at the workshop include
presentations, panels, tutorials, and roundtable
discussions.

**Everyone** is encouraged to speak.

## Why Present

* **Friendly Audiences**
* **Rewarding Experience**
* **Share Your Knowledge**
* **Contribute to the Community**


## Topics of Interest

Have a neat new tool you wrote that saves you time
and effort? Tell us about it. Have an idea you
want to try out on a bunch of people? Tell us
about it.  Have you done some performance tuning,
benchmarking, or automated testing?  We would love
to hear more!
