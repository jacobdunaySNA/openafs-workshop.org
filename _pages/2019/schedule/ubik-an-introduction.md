The OpenAFS filesystem relies on the Ubik subsystem to provide consistency and
availability (automatic failover) for its distributed database servers
(vlserver, ptserver, buserver, and kaserver).  We will provide a broad overview
of Ubik, including its origins, theory, architecture, implementation,
operation, advantages, current issues, and futures.  Anyone who uses OpenAFS,
administers an AFS cell, or writes code for OpenAFS should find something of
interest in this talk;  no prior knowledge of Ubik is required.
