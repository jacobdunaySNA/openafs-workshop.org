As an OpenAFS site grows, it inevitably shifts from using a single cell to
using multiple. Some sites have developed their own solution for releasing
volumes across such cells, but these tend to involve internal proprietary
tools. In this talk, we'll take a look at a free software solution for
cross-cell volume synchronization, called CellCC ("cell carbon-copy").
