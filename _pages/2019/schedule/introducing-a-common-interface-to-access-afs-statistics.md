Solaris 11.4 introduced a new feature named **StatsStore** which provides a
common namespace to access performance data from multiple sources. This
presentation will demonstrate how we can use StatsStore with OpenAFS, and how
we can access the same data in a similar way on other platforms. This will
hopefully allow us to access all OpenAFS statistics via one common interface
not just on Solaris, but on all platforms.
