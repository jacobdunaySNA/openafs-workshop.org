title: DTrace/SystemTap SDT Probes in OpenAFS
permalink: /2019/schedule/dtrace-systemtap-probes-in-openafs/
---

Tools like DTrace and SystemTap can be very useful, but using them with
existing OpenAFS releases tends to require developer-level knowledge in order
to be useful. In this talk, we'll take a look at some SDT (statically defined
tracing) probes written for OpenAFS that make it easy for anyone to extract
high-level data. Specifically this talk will focus on vlserver operations using
DTrace on Solaris, but this should also be useful for anyone interested in the
same topic for Linux or SystemTap.
