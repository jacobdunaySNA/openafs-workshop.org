Robot Framework is a general-purpose open source automation framework for
acceptance test driven development (ATDD), which uses a keyword-driven testing
approach with a text-based test case syntax. We will be presenting an automated
test suite for OpenAFS clients and servers, consisting of a Robot Framework
test suite and a Robot Framework extension library written in Python. The tests
and library are all open source and available on GitHub.
